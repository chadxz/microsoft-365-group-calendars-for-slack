# Microsoft 365 Group Calendar for Slack

This Slack app brings Microsoft 365 Group Calendars into Slack. You can:

* [ ] Be notified of created, updated, and deleted events
* [ ] Get reminders for events
* [ ] Get a daily summary of events

If you are familiar with the Slack app "[Google Calendar for Team Events][gcal]",
this app is like that, only for Microsoft 365 Groups Calendars.

This app contrasts to the official "[Microsoft Outlook][official]" Slack app,
which is designed to bring an _individual's_ Microsoft Outlook calendar into
Slack.
